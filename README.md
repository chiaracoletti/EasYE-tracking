# E*as*YE TRACKING with OPENCV

We are developing an easy and accessible eye tracking software that identify faces, eyes and iris in a video.
It requires only a common computer and the open source **OPENCV** library to work (NO expensive hardware required!!!).
We chose opencv because it is open source, easy to use, and it provides some great code for object detection in images and videos, which perfectly fitted our needs. 
The code is written in Python.

##Getting started
* Make sure you already have opencv on your computer, the cascades we used should already be included. 
* Move the cascades' files in your working directory.
* Download the code and enjoy! (we used jupyter)

##Contributors:
We are two students of Biomedical Engineering @Politecnico di Milano, this project is the final result of our Computer Science course. 
We are also participating in the Xilinx Pynq Hackathon, in july 2016.
